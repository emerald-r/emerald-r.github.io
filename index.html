            <h4>Serials in contrast with reality are over-dramatic and exaggerate small issues to be life changing. Each moment takes a lot of time but yet does not have much material to be displayed. In reality, such trivial issues are ignored. There are both the interesting, educating, entertaning, realistic type as well as the elongated, addictive family melodramas which exert negative influnce to the public audience. In contrast, the educative type of serials are worth watching and provide a nice storyline which can be adaptive. There are also a few entertaining serials which are stress free and humourous after long hours of work. In reality, except for the few coincidences, these events are not realistic. Even if these happen, the mindset of the people would not be as generic as in the serial. The influence of the melodramatic type of serials would cause the illiterate to follow the footsteps of the antagonists.</h4>
